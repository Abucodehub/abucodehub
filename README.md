# 💫 About Me:
I am a backend-focused developer building real-world systems from the ground up with a strong emphasis on clean architecture, scalability, and long-term maintainability.<br><br>Currently, I am working on a backend-first product, where I design APIs, databases, and authentication flows before touching the frontend. I prefer slow, deliberate development over rushed implementations, ensuring that every component is well-structured and production-ready.<br><br>My primary stack revolves around Python, Flask/Django, and SQL-based databases, with a growing focus on system design, API security (JWT), and data modeling. I enjoy breaking complex problems into simple, reliable backend solutions.<br><br>I am actively looking to collaborate on backend systems, API-driven products, and automation projects, and I value thoughtful feedback on architecture, scalability, and real-world engineering decisions.<br><br>I believe strong products are built through clarity, discipline, and consistency, not shortcuts.
